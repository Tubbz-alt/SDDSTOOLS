This directory contains various scripts for running
a Shower simulation.

The main script that is called by the user is
"sim_shower.sh".

- - -

Usage:

 sim_shower.sh <input> <output> <geom> [limit]

Example:

 sim_shower.sh input.sdds output.sdds nc.geom 0.05

- - -

It takes an Elegant formatted SDDS file for input.

- - -

It produces an Elegant formatted SDDS file as output.

- - -

The geometry file to be used by Shower must be
specified by the user. An example geometry file is
provided and may be edited to suit the user's needs.

The geometry file must contain the following line:

 outputfile="%s.show"

This line should be included in the definition of
the collection volume.

- - -

The user may specify a limit for the momentum filter.
The filter is automatically applied. If no limit is
given, the default behavior approximates no filter
at all.

Particles satisfying

 |dp/p| > limit

are removed from the output.

NOTE: The limit is not given as a percentage.

- - -

There is a script that runs Shower from inside
Elegant using a SCRIPT element. This script is
called "metasim.sh", and is for demonstrative
purposes only.

It takes the same arguments as the "sim_shower.sh"
script, as well as the name of the script to be
used to run the Shower simulation (i.e.
"sim_shower.sh").

The SCRIPT element takes the current state of the
beam and exports it to the Shower script, then
takes the output from the Shower script and feeds
it back into the Elegant beamline.

- - -

Usage:

 metasim.sh <script.sh> <input> <output> <geom> [limit]

Example:

 metasim.sh sim_shower.sh input.sdds output.sdds nc.geom 0.05

- - -

The Elegant lattice file used by the "metasim.sh" script
is called "shower.lte". Its contents can basically be
cut and pasted into another lattice file, allowing for
seamless integration of Elegant and Shower in a single
simulation call.

- - -

See the scripts and files themselves for more details.

An example SDDS input file and geometry file have been
provided for convenience of testing.
